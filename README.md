# radioiiitd
takes discord bot integration to fetch audio streams from yt and play through some media server that can encode and output to an icecast server instance.

# current to-do-list
-figure out way to control mopidy payback from python script
-figure out youtube extension control for mopidy

# currently accomplished/ working functionality
-output pipeline for playback on icecast server
i.e can play local files in mopidy and config file pipes audio to icecast server
-nextcord and pytube api for yt search through argument

# can do rn
- can probably make a workaround temp folder to download mp3 streams and manually play back  somehow using playlist config file or smthn
-MAJOR UPDATE
playback without downloads through cache purely is now doable only playback control remain to be implemented
and embeds ig
